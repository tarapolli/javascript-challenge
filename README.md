# javascript-challenge:  "ALIENS-R-REAL" 

Using "ALIENS-R-REAL" UFO sightings data, I created an dynamic site that allows users to filter data based upon their chosen date.  Using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and D3.js, you may navigate this site to search data. Based upon your date selected, the output will show you a table with the follow data:  date, city, state, country, shape and comments. https://tarapolli.github.io/javascript-challenge/
